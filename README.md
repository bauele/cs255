# CS-255 System Analysis and Design
Project demonstrating ability to analyze user requirements and design functional software to meet user needs.


### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a business venture by Liam and Ian. The purpose was to create a business that would offer training to student drivers in order to better prepare them for their driving tests. They wanted to create an online system that would allow for students to register for driving packages and then schedule appointments to use their purchased time. 

### What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did a great job determining the requirements for the project. By reading the provided interview transcript, I was able to evaluate the needs of the system and break them down into functional and nonfunctional requirements.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the flowcharts. In my opinion, flowcharts can be difficult to create. When sitting down to break apart a process, someone can choose to provide a simple, high-level overview that focuses on explaining the overall goal of that process. However, being concise runs the risk of glossing over specifical details. In my UML Activity Diagram, I only wrote "Show available dates/times" as one of the steps on my diagram, but how exactly is this accomplished? Had I wanted to, I could have specificed that an asynchronous call should be made to the database to query for the appointments. I could have also shown this result being returned to the caller, and then even explained how the results should be graphically displayed on the screen. Doing so would have been overkill for the sake of this project, but in the real world such level of detail might be necessary.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read through the provided interview transcript several times, taking notes on how they were describing what they wanted the system to do. It is important to consider the user's needs in order to make sure that time and money are being invested in features that will provide value for the client. If resources are spent on features that do not help the client achieve their goal, then those resources are just being wasted. 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software is to determine as many needs as I can possibly identify. After doing so, I rank these requirements from most important to least important. I'll decide on what core features need to be present in a minimum viable product and then get to work on implementing those features. One important strategy is to share progress with the client as often as possible in order to ensure that both parties are in agreement that the project is progressing as desired.
